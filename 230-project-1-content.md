# Paper Airplane Tilt

## I. Concept
It's [Paper Airplane Chase](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/imYTCK6u4ZIsVzr4M0rWuc653FfakqL3), but for mobile devices and use with tilt controls.

## II. Genre
Action.

## III. Platform
Mobile only, as it will be played using tilt controls.

## IV. Story
There is no real story to the original Paper Airplane Chase, and there will be no real story to this take on it. The paper airplane will just come through a window and the player will start controlling it.

## V. Aesthetics
Pixel art, akin to the original's style, but not using the same assets from the original.

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
* The straighter your paper airplane is, the faster you will go
* The farther you progress, the harder it gets, as the walls will grow in size

### Control
The game will be controlled using the accelerometer.

### Teaching the game
The game will have no tutorial levels. It will simply have a menu screen that says "tilt to steer," or something along those lines before starting the game.

### Player learning
The player will start to get the hang of the different levels of speed the airplane can do, and will start adjusting better to the distance between walls and how fast to go.

## VII. Screenshots
Below are images from the original Paper Airplane Chase (the second one is from [Paper Plane](https://www.mariowiki.com/Paper_Plane_(minigame)), the predecessor to Paper Airplane Chase).
Paper Airplane Tilt will attempt to recreate this style without using the original game's assets.

## VIII. Other
Paper Airplane Tilt is meant to be a game that will be easy to pick up and play. It does not take much time to learn, but getting the right timing down will take some practice.
Paper Airplane Tilt will have a varying average playtime, as it will depend on if the player is just playing to kill a few minutes, or if they're trying to beat a friend's score!
Paper Airplane Tilt will have one level, and it will be endless. At some point, the walls will stop growing, as it will be incredibly hard to maneuver around bigger walls when you are going at high speeds.

## IX. About the Developer
I'm Zack Dunham and I'm a second year Game Design and Development major. My skill set is currently growing, but at the moment, I know some HTML/CSS and C#.
My interests include video games, movies, and music. I also really enjoy hacking games and consoles, and I'm actually going to start learning C++ outside of class to build 3DS Homebrew.
